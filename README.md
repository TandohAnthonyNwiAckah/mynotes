# MY NOTES v1.0.0
A simple Web Application for a client to view the 
```stored content``` in their preferred language.
The display is data stored in a database in multiple languages ```(English and French)```
This project comes in Two-part namely the Frontend Part and the Backend Part.

The Backend was built using ```ASP.Net Core``` with ```SQL server``` and the Frontend was built using ```Quasar VueJS``` which gives us a lot of opportunities to deploy on multi-platforms.

Built this project currently for the Web using ```Single Page Application (SPA)```.
This project doesnâ€™t need to reload the page during its use and works within a browser.

For this project to run perfectly, Both the Backend part (.NET Core) and Frontend Part(Quasar) should be running smoothly.

Backend runs on ```port 8006``` whilst the Frontend on ```port 8007``` when running it locally.
